## Assignment 8

This is a simple program that uses command line arguments from when the user to get a given place in the fibonacci sequence, which then takes the 
place and calculates the number that would be there and outputs it to the user. There are two .jar files, they are functionally the same, there
were no specifications on how to approach this problem so I did it two ways. FibonacciRecursion.jar calculates the Fibonacci number through a
recursive function, and FibonacciSequence.jar calculates it through conditional statements and a while loop.
